As the first-person cameras like GoPro become popular for some sports hobbyists and geeks, there would be more first-person videos in the near future. Most of the video online, such as youtube, are shot in third person video. And, the research of video action recognition on first-person videos is still in the beginning. We want to see if the deep learning models can also apply on the recognition of the first-person videos and whether they perform well as for the images and third-person videos. 

At first, we did experiments on the popular deep CNN model, Caffeâ€™s Imagenet pre-train model, which adopts the same architecture as AlexNet. Based on this model, we fine-tune AlexNet by training both first-person and third-person point-of- view frames from videos. Then we use un-training dataset to evaluate classification accuracy rate of first-person and third-person point-of-view videos. Besides, to find a better network for recognizing first-person video, we also fine-tune C3D and GoogLeNet on Caffe. Results of three networks for C3D, Alexnet and GoogleNet are 76%, 68% and 68% separately. We can see that C3D gets the best performance among these three architectures for video recognition. This suggests that including motion information helps improve video accuracy rate.
